<h1 class="h4">Rules</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        All predictions are based on the <strong>end of the season</strong> and the results will be
        updated after each episode.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Alive:</strong> the character is still alive at the end of the season.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Dead:</strong> for example, a character is blown up by wildfire.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Dead, becomes a wight:</strong> means the character dies and is resurrected as a wight.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Please note:</strong> any character that becomes a wight and is destroyed afterwards is
        still considered as *Dead, becomes a Wight*
    </li>
    <li>
        Points are being rewarded as the show goes on. Points for correct 'Alive' predictions will only
        be rewarded at the end of the show.
    </li>
    <li>
        All characters that have been resurrected previously, for example Jon Snow and The Mountain, are
        considered to be alive at the beginning of the season.
    </li>
    <li>
        If a character does not appear at all in the season, the prediction related to that character
        will not count. For example: if you think Daario will survive and he doesn't appear in the
        season, you will not receive any points.
    </li>
